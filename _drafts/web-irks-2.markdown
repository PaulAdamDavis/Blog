* Web pages that have maps embeded (generally a good thing) but have them fill almost the whole screen, so you can't scroll the page anymore because you're panning the map. This applies for both desktop and mobile.
* sites that ask you to subscribe on the first visit within 5 seconds of openening the page. At least check to see if I've visited before, or when I've reached the end of the article. Or better yet, don't pop up. If I want to subscribe, I'll find the box on the side bar. I'm sure if does convert better, but fuck me is it annoying. Forcing a subscribe box in front of a user may get them to subscribe, but do they _really_ want to, or did you shove it down their throat?
