_precede: (noun) ‘come before (something) in time’_

My most successful open source project under my own name was my WordPress starter theme, [Slim Starkers](https://github.com/PaulAdamDavis/Slim-Starkers). It’s not been updated since September 2013 and I’ve not used it since then, but I’m sure it still works. I will update that at some point.

Today, I want to share the continuation of that. Unsurprisingly, it’s a blank theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org).

**[Precede](https://github.com/PaulAdamDavis/Precede)** is a theme for Ghost that _features_ no CSS. It only has the files and tags you need to get content. The rest is up to you – a great point to start a new custom theme.

I will keep Precede up to date, often adding features right after they land in the master branch of Ghost itself, before they are released to the world. This means that if you use the master branch to build themes locally, it has the latest and greatest features. Combine that with the fast release cycle of Ghost, when it comes to releasing the theme, it should be as current as it can be.

It also means you have a barebones example of new features in use that you can reference in preexisting themes. Worth noting that Ghost’s [Theme documentation](http://themes.ghost.org/) is wonderfully written and will offer much more information than an example will – well worth reading.

Precede is MIT licence, so do what you like with it[^1]. And of course, it’s open source, so please feel free to fork, update and open issues.
