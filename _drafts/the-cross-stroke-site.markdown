title: The Cross Stroke Site
---

I thought I should note down some of the details of the [Cross Stroke](https://crossstroke.co) site[^1].

I had much of the site sitting at a now defunct but public url or *hire.pad.gs*, so a lot of this was done a while ago. I even wrote about [how I made my availability table](http://pad.gs/2014/02/11/the-new-codebymonkey-com/#automation) a while ago, back end I had a shitty name. That table has undergone a lot of changes, but the same theory still applies.

Here, I want to show how I did the header, which uses multiple backgrounds, blend modes and animations â€“ it animates the gradient over the top of the image. Sounds simple, but was a tad more complex than I imagined.
