title: My Setup
---

In lei of of better things to blog about (they're happening elsewhere), I thought I'd spend a little time and write about my current Mac setup. It's nothing amazing, but it's taken me a lot of time to work out the most productive way to have it all set up.

## Mac

I currently use a late 2012 13" Retina MacBook Pro (Yosemite, 2.5Ghz i5, 8GB RAM, 128gb SSD, Intel HD 4000 1024MB). I also have a [Samsung S24D590](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/pc-peripherals/monitors/design/LS24D590PLX/XU) 24" external display connected via HDMI. I also use a wired Apple keyboard and Magic Trackpad.

## Speakers

Several years ago, I bought some cheap [studio monitor speakers](https://www.studiospares.com/Headphones-and-Speakers/Studio-Monitors/Studiospares-Seiwin-Powered-Monitors-(Pair)_248030.htm). They may be cheap, and not that accurate, but fuck me they're better than just about every set of typical computer speakers. Bad audio can damage - I do not want that.

They are driven via a USB [Edirol UA-25](http://www.roland.com/products/en/UA-25/) which I got at the same time as the speakers. I've also had the same red & green (left is red/port & right is green/starboard?) Neutrik 1/4" jack cables since I got the speakers & interface.

## Desk

Like everyone else on the planet, I have an Ikea desk. A [Linnmon](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50251350/) with 4 adjustable [Gerton](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/60261626/) legs, which is important if you care about posture but don't want to stand. For the chair, I went with a [Vilgot](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30193182/). It's no Aeron, but it'll do until I win the lottery.

My Mac site on a [Twelve South HiRise](https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-for-macbook). Both that HiRise and the monitor sit on some [cheap cardboard boxes](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/40240102/) which are filled with crap I never use to give them some weight & rigidity.

## Voice/Podcast Setup

Yeah, I know, I haven't been on a podcast in forever, but when I am, I sound awesome! That's mostly due to my [sE X1](http://www.seelectronics.com/se-x1-microphone) condenser mix which runs through the USB interface via a nice long Neutrik XLR cable I acquired a ling time ago. I have a cheap unbranded pop-shield which clamps onto a cheap unbranded mic stand.

As for day to day audio for Hangouts and the like, I use the Mac's built in mic with a pair of [Sennheiser CX 300-II](http://en-uk.sennheiser.com/isolating-earphones-stereo-cx-300-ii-precision) ear buds.

## On Mess & Cleanliness

I'd absolutely love to have one of those desks that gets featured on designer-porn blogs, but I live in the same house my desk is in, so it gets covered in mugs, food wrappers and other pits & pieces.

I can guarantee that turning my keyboard over will yield a few kilos of toast crumbs and nail clippings.

## What's next?

I would like to invest in a kneeling chair which will further help my posture, though I don't think I could use it all the time, so would switch between that and my regular chair at regular intervals.

I'm also saving for a 27" Retina iMac, which means my rMBP will become redundant at my desk. I won't sell it - remote work kinda dictates having a laptop - but it won't get used daily. When I get that, I'll mount my current external display on its side and have a vertical screen for apps that need to be open but aren't a focus.

I would also like to build my own desk (I did wood work at school, y'know) and get a [Phillips goLITE BLU energy light](http://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/HF3330_01/golite-blu-rechargeable-international-adapters), which is meant to help me feel more energetic on dreary days, which is a lot of the time in England.

Lastly, I want to run a ethernet cable up to the office. Wi-fi is brilliant, but ethernet is better.

Anyway, back to work.
