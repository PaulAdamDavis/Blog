title: May's Challenge
---

I've spend the last 4 months trying to improve my sleeping pattern and work habits. I've improved a bit, but there's always work to do. I could spend each & every month trying to improve _something_ about how I eat, work, and sleep but that's all I'll ever achieve. My 'efforts' could be better used in other places.

For May, I want to do something a little different for me.
Ghost's admin UI is built on Ember; couple that with my job title being _front-end architect_, I should really have a bloody good grasp on Ember.

I can do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 'till the cows come home, but I should also be able to write Ember.js with my eyes closed, or at least not need to ask questions about _everything_ and spend so long trying to understand what the docs mean.

Ever single day, I'm going to watch a conference presentation on Ember.js and Ember-CLI. A whole month of Ember. At the end of May, I want to be able to tackle almost any of the [Ember issues](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/labels/ember) in the Ghost GitHub project.

I'm gonna list them all here, just incase they're useful for anyone. :)
