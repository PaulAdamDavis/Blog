title: Why I Gave Up Freelancing

Surprisingly, I haven't had this question a lot, but I think it's worth sharing my thoughts on why I left the world of freelancing in favour of a full time job, of sorts.

For a lot of this to make sense, we need some context. So let's go back a few years.
This is a long one, grab a drink.

After a year of doing really cheap sites for artists on [deviantART](http://www.deviantart.com/), I got my first agency job in September 2009. I spent just under three months there, as a junior developer. The team I worked with were awesome, but almost everyone on the team had an escape plan.

In my hunt for an agency job in the year prior to getting my first, I came across an agency in London that gave me some freelance work. That agency later asked if I'd like to work for them on a full-time basis, in house. I accepted the job on the spot and handed in my notice at that first job.

On the last day of that first job, when it was time to leave, I said my goodbyes to my team and walked out, past the management, saying nothing to them.

A year into the London job, I realised I was spending 1/3 of my wages getting to work, as they were two hours away. I looked for a local job, which I interviewed for twice, and got an offer which I accepted. I left that job in under 3 months again. The entire team were great, especially my fellow developers who I still look up to today. I just wasn't feeling it.

I asked the London agency if they'd have me back. Luckily they said yes. I wanted to go back because I was familiar with the team. It was small and everyone was nice. I was treated as an equal.

In my time there, I got to work on some awesome stuff. I was basically the lead WP developer, which was amazing. Life was interesting and mostly fun. That was until my car died and I needed some extra cash to help pay for a new car. This is when I started doing some freelance work in the evenings.

I enjoyed it a lot. Being in control of what I do, how and when was very empowering. After receiving a .net award in November 2011, I decided I wanted to try freelancing full time. Many of the people I admired in our industry were freelancers, so I kinda thought that it would help boost my profile and give me some great opportunities like speaking and traveling to work. I started in April 2012.

About 3 months into freelancing, I realised it wasn't all it was cracked up to be, but at the time it was better than commuting to work. I kept with it, safe in the knowledge that I hand't been short of work, even though I never asked for it, which was *very* lucky.

In the summer of 2013, I started having thoughts about looking for full-time jobs with startups and possibly agencies, but I'd suppress those thoughts and tell myself that freelancing was the best I'd get, without loosing so much time & freedom.

But the thoughts kept coming back, so I gave in to temptation and asked a local agency who I'd freelances for previously if I could work with them. I explained all this to the owner over coffee, and we mutually decided a 1 month trial was a good way for me to find out if a full time job was what I wanted.

The trial went well I think, I helped them out on a few things, but ultimately, I didn't stay for longer than the month. What the trial did teach me though, is that I really missed being on a team.

It took me 6 months to work it out, but I realised what I needed. For me to give a job my all, I need to be mentally invested in it. Building a website for a client then not seeing it again for several months was soul destroying for me.

For me to give a job the best I could, I needed a product.

The trouble was, most product jobs meant relocating or commuting. I know there are a few companies that are exclusively remote, or some of the team are, but the barrier to entry for those jobs was rather high, given the companies were well established and typically have a corporate culture, which tends to not give anyone without a degree a second look.

My history with Ghost is short. I briefly spoke to John about it when the idea was to fork WordPress or make a plugin for it. We had a little chat on Skype months before the Kickstarter campaign about me helping out with it. Alas, at the time, I didn't didn't have the capacity to work on it, so that was that.

In December 2013, I saw a tweet from Ghost about jobs. I knew I loved the idea of the project already. The job listing sounded absolutely perfect for me. Completely remote, explicit freedom, and the usual perks like personal development and global meetups.

Not being driven by money was good too. I have long been a sceptic of the ways typical startups work and the all to often hidden agenda. Being a [not-profit company](http://john.onolan.org/what-it-means-to-be-non-profit/) was right up my street.

It sounded *perfect* for me.  I applied, and months later, here I am. A Ghost.

## So why did I give up freelancing?

I want to be *invested* in something.
I want to be with a project as it *grows* bigger and better.
I want a team to *collaborate* with.
