title: Naming Cross Stroke
---

This was honestly the hardest part. I had a lot of criteria to meet with the name. It needed to:

* Be easy to spell - There, their, or they're?
* Have no numbers - 16, sixteen, 6teen
* Have no hyphens - Yuk
* Work well for one person or 50
* Not be specific to web, visual design or development
* Preferably, be a dot com
* Have the twitter name available 

I'm not crazy on the name, but the typographers among you will know what it is, and how 'Cross Stroke' only has one of them.

For inspiration, I looked to big agencies like Dare and Poke. I really like the names and searched endlessly for similar verbs, but I couldn't find any I liked. It's very possible I'll change the name in the future, but for now, it'll do.

So for now, I'm called Cross Stroke Limited, with the web address crossstroke.co. I think of it as 'cross stroke company'. Though telling my parents the domain name immediately prompted a "do you mean dot com?" comments. _sigh_ At least my target market is more tech savvy and will recognise it's not a mistake.
