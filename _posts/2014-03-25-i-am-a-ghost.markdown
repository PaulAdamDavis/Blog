On April 2nd 2012, I left the world of full-time work and started freelancing. I've had a lot of fun and some some amazing with for brilliant people. I gave it a damn good go,  but ultimately, it wasn't for me

Today, I am excited to announce that **I am joining [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)** as a Front-End Architect.


**How do I feel?** Really fucking excited.
