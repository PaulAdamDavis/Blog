I've always struggled with my weight, but not like most people; I struggle to put any weight on. I can eat whatever I like - in any quantity - and I never gain weight. Putting the health implications aside, I want to eat more.

I'm hoping that keeping a public record of what I eat along with some measurements, combined with some social pressure, will help me stay focused on eating more and slowly putting on weight by eating a normal amount of the *right* things.

I'm not calorie counting, and I'm not taking any supplements. I'm only going to list what I eat, in a rough order. At the end of each week, I'll share what I ate in that week.
