Something I didn’t write about in my [roundup of 2014](http://pad.gs/2014/12/31/2014-in-review/) was the plan to set myself a challenge each month - something to improve my life.

The idea isn’t to do things like loose a significant portion of fat from my body (haha!) or start the working day before the sun rises. The ides is to adjust small parts of my lifestyle to slowly improve it, in ways that won’t shock me into a cowering ball in the corner.

I’m unsure what the challenges are, or what size they’ll be, but I want to do one each month and keep progress of them here.

By the end of **January**, I want to be asleep by midnight and up before 8am every week-day and 9am on weekends.

What I want to achieve here is a more consistent sleeping pattern. To help me get that I’m going to track my sleep with an iOS app called [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/). I’m also going to stop watching TV until I just ~~pass out~~ fall asleep. I’ll report back in a few weeks and discuss my next challenge.
