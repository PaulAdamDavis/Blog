I'm thrilled to say I'm going to be speaking at [re:develop](http://redevelop.io/) in Bournemouth on Friday 22nd August 2014, alongside a whole host of great speakers.

It's still a while away, but times moves quickly, so go grab a ticket. It's a day off work (on a Friday!) and at only Â£70 (+vat, if that's your thing), it's pretty damn cheap too. :)

I'll be speaking about what it's like to work for a distributed company. The pros, the cons, the culture differences, the mindset needed for it, and so much more. If you've ever wondered how a modern, 100% distributed company works, this is your time to learn all.

So, head over to [redevelop.io](http://redevelop.io/), take it all in, then take our your money. See you there!
