When I first started blogging a few years ago, I started with the idea that I could write awesome tutorials, sell ad space and get stinking rich. With heinsight, it was the stupid idea of an idealistic 19 year old me.

Since then, i've grown up. The type of stuff I write has changed and my writing skill, despite my *hideous* grades at school, has increased dramatically.

With that, I have decided to stash my old blog away at [oldblog.pauladamdavis.com](http://oldblog.pauladamdavis.com) and start afresh here, on Ghost.
