title: Lessons Learnt From Keeping A Food Diary

A month ago, I started writing a food diary. I wanted to *see* what I was eating.
I've always known that I eat a lot of unhealthy stuff – these diaries confirmed that. I learnt I eat lots of chocolate, sweets, cake and cornish party slices. I also drink lots of coffee, but I'm not complaining about that.

* [Week 1](http://pad.gs/2014/11/10/food-diary-week-1/)
* [Week 2](http://pad.gs/2014/11/17/food-diary-week-2/)
* [Week 3](http://pad.gs/2014/11/24/food-diary-week-3/)
* [Week 4](http://pad.gs/2014/12/01/food-diary-week-4/)

I feel a month is a long enough period to get a decent overview of my eating habits. I didn't take down enough detail to make some sort of chart. I think it would've taken too long and I've have given up sooner. I could've taken down nutrition information, times, and all the water I drink, but I didn't.

Instead of writing something huge, I'm going to write a bullet list of what I know, and what I _want_ to do to _fix_ me. I like lists.

## The Bad

* I have no set meal times or eating patterns
* I never eat breakfast
* The amount I eat every day fluctuates greatly
* The lack of healthy food in my diet is startling
* Water is something I should drink a _lot_ more of
* This poor diet makes me feel sluggish, give supreme sugar highs and insomnia

## The Idea

* Eat a decently sized, healthy breakfast before 10am every day
* Eat lunch between 1pm and 2pm
* Eat a proper dinner
* Eat a healthy bed time snack every day (My body shape – ectomorph –  [dictates](http://www.menstylefashion.com/guys-do-you-know-your-body-shape/) I "eat before bed to prevent muscle catabolism during the night")
* Drink much more water each day, around 2 litres
* Start exercising in some form
* Give up caffeine after 6pm (I tend to sleep at 1am)

## The Goal

It's certainly not going to be easy, but I know it's something I need to do. Not for anyone else, but for my own wellbeing and general health. Diabetes or a heart attack are inevitable of I keep going like this.

I'm not trying to be a health nut – far from it – I just want to feel better all of the time.

Wish me luck!
