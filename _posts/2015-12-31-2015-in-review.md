Like [last year](http://pad.gs/2014/12/31/2014-in-review/), this year has been good. And as ever, plenty of ups and downs.

---

**January** was a fairly quiet month.

**February** was also fairly quiet, except Hayley & I booked a trip to Disneyland Paris.

In **March**, I asked Hayley's dad for his permission to propose, we went to Disney, and I proposed. it was lovely :)
I also left Ghost.

I spent all of **April** searching for my next venture, ultimately settling on [going freelance](http://pad.gs/2015/05/26/freelancing-the-return/) again, with a forward-thinking view of starting an agency.

**May** was when I decided on a name for the company, and got everything legally sorted. Accountant, business bank, Companies House stuff, yada yada yada.

In **June**, I ordered my new car, my brother also got married – I was best man. It's scary.

**August** was full of work for me, and [burnout](http://pad.gs/2015/11/18/burnout/).

**September** saw me, Haley, and her parents fly to Nice for a week of cocktails and sun. I also picked up my [new car](http://pad.gs/2015/12/01/my-ford-focus-st-3/) hours after landing.

In **October**, Hayley & booked another trip to Disney.

In late **November**, we travelled to Disney again, but I drove this time. It's cheaper, easier and more comfortable.

**December**, was just another normal month, aside form the couple weeks off at the end.

## Other Improvements

It's now been 17 months since I stopped smoking cigarettes, but I still vape daily. I did enjoy smoking, but I've lost the desire now. There's no feeling of tabboo when someone offers me one on nights out. Through no effort, I've also seemingly convinced a few friends to try vaping too.

I bought some [minoxidil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoxidil) a few months back, in an effort to help a bald patch on my chin. For a couple months, I saw no real changes, but that patch has a few dark hairs in it now, which is awesome! By the time I get through every bottle I have, I might have a non-patchy beard!

I got an Apple Watch in June, so that's nice.

Learning to separate work and life more has been a huge benefit to me. Given I plan to work (i.e. code) 6 hours a day, it means my typically later starts to the day don't eat into the evenings. That means my sleeping pattern can be what it wants to me, work gets done, and I have time for Hayley in the evenings – the way it should be. That doesn't mean I've stopped trying to wake up earlier though – i'd still like to start the days work at 6am and be done my the early afternoon.

And lastly, I have a much stronger sense of my finances. I now control how much I pay myself, when, and where that money goes once it's mine and not the businesses. That in itself doesn't change much, but it enabled me to plan a bit better. If business is good for a few months in a row (and continues to look good months ahead), I can give myself a little pay rise and pipe more money into our house savings. We'd like to buy a house in 2016, and we're getting closer each day.

Of course there's goals for 2016.

* Start working earlier
* Find another design agency client who use me for all their web dev work
* Continue with the house savings
* Grow that beard
* Put on some more weight
* _Pipe-dream time:_ Put on a little muscle
