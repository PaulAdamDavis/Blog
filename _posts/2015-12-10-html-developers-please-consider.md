> [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) allows developers to re-invent and extend native [HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) features in meaningful ways. But like all _bolt-on_ technologies its features are **[brittle](http://w3c.github.io/aria-in-html/#aria-touch)** compared to its _built-in_ counterparts.

I never bothered with ARIA roles. Like I've thought for years, using HTML the way it's _meant_ to be used is better.

It's true that it can sometimes be a pain to make form elements look and behave how you'd like them to, but in recent years, CSS has made it a lot easier to remove standard styling from form elements, and re-style them how you want. They retain their default functionality, which is almost always better than whatever someone in a decision-making position can dream up, but look how you want.

By using 'standard' HTML, everyone wins.
