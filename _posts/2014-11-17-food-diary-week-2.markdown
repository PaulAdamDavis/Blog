This is amazing! I'm carying on with a blog post series I started a week ago. Epic.

This week, I tried to eat less cakes & chocolate, a little more healthy stuff and more full meals. I think I hit my goal, even if only slightly.

Last week, I had 25 unnecessary chocolate & cakey things. This week, I had 22, which is a slight improvement.
