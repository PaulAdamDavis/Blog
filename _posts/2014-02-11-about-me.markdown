My name is Paul Davis. Iâ€™m 24. I'm a front-end developer.

Traditionally, every about page is a paragraph or two of well-written text that's full of fluff and lacking in details. This is why I have opted for a big list of stuff about me.

* Somehow, I was the [.net magazine Young Developer](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/net-awards-2011-winners-11116624) of the year in 2011.
* I get a lot of flak for having a BMW.
* Like everyone, I enjoy good coffee, using an [AeroPress](http://www.aeropresscoffee.co.uk/) in my case. I usually have 2 or 3 cups a day, each with 2 scoops in it.
* My desk has a 13" Retina MacBook Pro, semi-decent Samsung 24" monitor and 2 awesome studio monitor speakers, fed via an old USB interface.
* I also have a great condenser mic ready for podcasts, but it sits in a box most of the time.
* For almost two years, I was a freelancer. Before that, I spent three years at three agencies.
* My school grades were beyond diabolical, which meant I never went to collage or university.
* I've been playing drums since I was 11, which would be 12 years now.
* I also pick up my guitar a few times a day and play along with a song or two.
* 'Easily irritated' is a good way to describe me. Hence the [Web Irks](http://pad.gs/tag/web-irks/) series.
* Fuck, cunt, arse, twat, prick, and moist are words that regularly  exit my mouth.
