_Yes, the title comes from a Radiohead song. I was listening to it as I wrote this._

One of the issues I've faced in the past few months when wanting to post thins on this blog, is what belongs where? I now have a new [company website](https://crossstroke.co), which I'm slowly redesigning, and that includes a blog. Where would a web development post go? In the past, it would go here because it's the only place I had to put things. Now, they would go on the Cross Stroke blog. [^1]

I have a plan that will hopefully clear everything up. It involved a few new sites, that I'd hope to push live all at the same time.

1. Re-ignite my old [pauladamdavis.com](http://pauladamdavis.com) domain, and use that as a gateway to this blog, my company, events, projects, contact info, and link to anywhere I exist on the internet. It won't have a blog.
2. Move any development-related posts from this blog to the CS blog. This frees this blog to be about things I want to write about – my personal blog shouldn't be a business. [^2]
3. Keep the Cross Stroke site focused on work. I'm moving away from the one age design in favour of more detailed pages. It means I can focus on my work in a place that's meant for it. If I were to talk about client projects here, you'd all get pretty pissed.

My hope is that having a blog no-longer focused on work, I can write more about cars, opinions, music, holidays, my progress on [gaining 60lbs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2360lbsSwap%20from%3Apauladamdavis&src=typd) in weight and what Hayley & I going through as we plan or wedding and save to buy a house.

It's also a good excuse to design some things and play around with some new stuff I'd shy away from for client work in fear of taking too long. I'm not setting a timeline because I know I'll miss, but I would like to have it all done in a couple months. I'll tackle the list in order.

[^1]: I have several posts written there, ready for when it goes live. Who wants to publish an empty blog these days‽
[^2]: I've decided to keep my gateway site and the blog separate, because short URLs are nice, and keeps it focused.
