This is a list of anything & everything that annoy me, either a little or a lot. It’s in no particulate order and has no real reason to exist, other than possibly saving on Twitter rants which always go on for far too long. Anyway…

* Responsive websites which don’t responsive on anything larger than a small tablet.
* HUGE body copy. ARE YOU SHOUTING AT ME? WHAT’S SO IMPORTANT!?
* People who call their child a 'mini person' or 'thing'.
* Militant privacy activists with no power to do anything, i.e. armchair politicians.
* People who drink IPA's, coffee via obscure methods and skinny jeans but insist they're not hipsters.
