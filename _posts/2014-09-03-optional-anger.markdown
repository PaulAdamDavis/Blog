Not a day goes by without someone - or something - wreaking havoc on the internet. It's usually spread on Twitter, where the character limit imposes a lack of context. Nobody can fit a good, solid argument into 140 characters. And spreading that argument over several tweets doesn't work either, because people selectively retweet the parts that interest them, meaning others who read it have even less context, and it continues on and on.

Whether you want to be part of the argument is your choice. The way I see it, you have two options:

1. Don't say anything. Let it move down your stream and forget about it.
2. Get involved, keep involved and stand your ground whilst keeping you humility.

There is nothing worse on Twitter than chiming in on an argument then leaving it. It's like seeing a bar fight between other people, throwing one punch, and walking away. What good does that do?

I admit that I'm somewhat guilty here. I have chimed in on arguments before, and its rarely ended with me walking away having left a positive impact - I just settle into the background with my tail between my legs.

Over the past few months, I've been making a conscious effort to not get into arguments or incite any sort of dislike to specific people. I've slipped once of twice, but I'm really trying.

What has that resulted in? I've unfollowed a lot of people who seem to get a kick out of licking others bullshit, and blocked people who constantly create bullshit.  My stream is now much easier to keep up with and be positive with. Any other bullshit that creeps in, is quickly drowned out by the non-bullshit nice people share. It may be circumstantial, but I feel my attitude towards Twitter has changed for the better - I'm happier with it than I was before.

I feel that's because I'm exposed to less bullshit in total, so I can tolerate the small amount that gets through. Having a positive attitude makes it easy to not be affected by negativity. The more negativity seen, the harder it is to ignore. In this case, ignorance is bliss.

So what am I getting at? Well, I'm *choosing* to not get angry by filtering out the right stuff and refusing to get involved in others bullshit.

I'm *choosing* to not get angry.
