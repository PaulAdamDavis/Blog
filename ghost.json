If I had to be given a class, I would say I was a good designer, not a great one. Let me explain why.\n\nGood design is something that fulfils a purpose, it gets the job done. It can look pretty, clean and professional, but it can also look horrible but get the job done equally well, Amazon being a perfect example. It looks horrible in my opinion, bur clearly *works* very well for them. This is a good design.\n\nGreat design is something that fulfils its purpose just as well as the good design, but also gets peoples attention because of its artistic qualities.

It looks horrible in my opinion, bur clearly <em>works</em> very well for them.

A chat on Twitter turning into a huge blog post that's essentially me ranting for a while, pissing off some people and alienating others.\n\nMy topic today is a controversial one too. **Pricing**. Someone tweeted a [link to an old study](http://cole007.net/blog/86/freelance-rates-survey-2011) by [Cole Henley](http://cole007.net/) that looks into how much peep charge per day in relation to what they do and where they live. There was a [link](http://www.fraq.info/) in there that helped you quickly work out what you should be charging, though simply done. Mine came to £186. I tweeted this with the comment that it was close to half my daily rate. So disclosure needed: I charge £320 a day (as of 16th November 2011). Some people seemed gobsmacked by that! Andy Clarke himself once said in a video interview that he charges £800 a day. That was a couple years ago, he may be the £1200 person in that link earlier. Is also could be anyone. Don't quote me. (If I find out who does charge that £1200, I'll note that here)  \nSome perspective there.\n\nA conversation then ensued about pricing and we all pretty much agreed to blog about it instead, so here I am.\n\n## Why So Much?\n\nBefore I began in the web, I had no idea what to charge, so the boss of the company I did my first freelance gig gave me the rate of £30 p/h, £240 a day. I took it. It seems that's more than some people with years of experience change today. That's silly.\n\nMy feeling is that you should increase your price until the work starts to dry up, so you end up with a balance of the higher prices and constant work.\n\nA few benefits of high prices are that you feel more motivated to work, at least I do anyway. Also, you tend to scare away sillier clients who want the world for a hundred quid. As soon as they see a high price, they usually run a mile. That's not always the case though. As I've slowly upped my pricing, I've seen the quality of work that comes through the metaphorical door rise dramatically. Again, that might just be me though.\n\n## Skill Level?\n\nYeah I admit it, I'm not a man with a couple kids, mortgage, decades of experience or knowledge, but I know my shit and if people are coming *to me*, knowing my price and are willing to pay for it, I'd be a fool to say no, if I can do the work they want.\n\nI've been lucky enough to work with a small but well respected agency in the music and fashion industries, letting me get some big names in my quiet portfolio that potential clients see. That's let me prove myself. I am lucky, I know that.\n\n## Type of pricing\n\nOne of the subjects that came up was how people price things and how that related to an hourly cost. In my opinion, that shouldn't matter. Whatever you charge hourly, daily or per project, the amount of time you actually spend on the project will be roughly the same. Putting discounts for large per-project quotes aside, you'll earn the same cash. Might just be me.\n\nIf I am quoting for an entire project, I still price things up in hourly costs first and just bunch it together, maybe take a few hours off as a thanks.\n\n## Regularly?\n\nNo not really, though I would love to be a full time freelancer and have loads of time to do client work and my own projects. That day will come. Until then, I have the luxury of not living off my freelancing money (I have a full time job doing the same stuff), which means I can afford to push my luck a bit. My thinking is that by the time I go to freelance full time I'll have a high enough rate for me to only need one week's client work a month and live solely from that and use my other time to do personal projects like Kodery and admin stuff.\n\nLet's talk on Twitter about it.

It's a departure from my usual sense of design, and in this case, thinking.

It's well known that you should only advertise the work you did, if you want to do it again, so I have not included things like HTML emails or e-commerce.\n\n#### Rates\n\nShowing my rates high up on the page serves a few purposes. It filters away people who want Facebook for £100 and shows people i'm serious. Typically, good developers aren’t cheap.\n\nHaving the minimum booking time means that I know that whatever is booked in, is at least a days work. This way, I avoid trying to switch my brain around at some point in the day. This is a major killer for productivity and from past experience, a huge time waster for me.\n\n#### Availability\n\nIt’s here that I state that there’s a time limit of 30 hours per week, or 6 hours a day. I do this here as it related to the weeks listed below. The email links contains a subject with the week days in it, which should help be quickly filter emails and reply more timely.\n\nThe block dates are automated, so a certain extent. I’ll detail that below.\n\n#### Legal\n\nI hate having to sign NDA’s, so I’ve chosen to get each one looked over by a lawyer each time. The fee helps pay them, and also for my time spent speaking to the lawyer and the client, printing it, archiving it, possibly adjust my workflow to suit its constraints etc etc. I would hope tat having a NDA fee would scare most away from bothering.\n\n### Portfolio\n\nNo images?! Yes, that’s right.\n\nI’m a developer, I code stuff. If I put screenshots of what I’ve built in my portfolio, i’m showcasing the work the designers did, which is counterproductive. I want to show the end product which I created, not the designers work, even if it is pretty as hell.\n\n### More About Me\n\nI just lifted this from my old website. It’s just an overview about who I am and what I strive for. It adds a personal touch, as I prefer to be friendly with my clients, not all dry and impersonal.\n\n## Automation\n\nI wanted to make this site very easy to maintain. It has no CMS, but a PHP file (yes, PHP) that has all the data in it, such as date blocks and portfolio items.\n\nThe portfolio stuff is typical, just an array, but the date stuff is a little more interesting.\n\n```language-php\n$dates = array(\n  array(\n    'start_stamp' => strtotime('10-02-2014'),\n    'end_stamp' => strtotime('14-02-2014'),\n    'available' => false\n  ),\n  array(\n    'start_stamp' => strtotime('17-02-2014'),\n    'end_stamp' => strtotime('21-02-2014'),\n    'available' => false\n  )\n);\n```\n\nEarlier on in the file, I set the timezone to `Europe/London`, so all I need to do to add date blocks is the date, in the proper `dd-mm-yyyy` format.\n\nThis is what I use to work out if I am available, and when, just based on the dates I have in the `$dates` array.\n\n```language-php\n// First month info\n$first_month_available = search($dates, 'available', true);\n$first_month_available = $first_month_available[0];\n$first_day = date('j', $first_month_available['start_stamp']);\n$first_month = date('F', $first_month_available['start_stamp']);\n$first_month_num = date('n', $first_month_available['start_stamp']);\n$first_year = date('Y', $first_month_available['start_stamp']);\n$first_days_in_month = cal_days_in_month(CAL_GREGORIAN, $first_month_num, $first_year);\n$early_or_late = (($first_day / $first_days_in_month) > 0.5) ? 'late' : 'early';\n\n// Am I available?\n$available = ($first_month_available) ? true : false;\n```\n\nI also automate various costs, so I have a few variables which are just echoed throughout the site.\n\n```language-php\n$price_per_hour = 50;\n$minimumn_block_hours = 6;\n$minimumn_block_price = ($price_per_hour * $minimumn_block_hours);\n$hours_per_week = 30;\n$nda_fee = 600;\n```\n\n---\n\nIt's nothing amazing, nothing new, but it's easy for me to change and serves its purpose well.

A lot of others don't degrade gracefully when the vertically centred content is taller than its container._\n\n## Flexbox\n\nWe've all heard of flexbox, but I've always struggled to think of decent use-cases. That was partially down to the browsers I'd need to support, but mostly because the stuff I'd need to build just didn't need it. Recently, I started using it for various things now that the browser support at Ghost is IE10 and up (which is epic!). Having native support for flexbox in our target browsers is brilliant, and with the [Flexie](https://github.com/doctyper/flexie) polyfill, we can also support IE9 and down, which i'm sure some people are thankful for. With that out of the way, let's look at vertical alignment with flexbox.\n\nThe downside to writing flexbox is that it has [3 specs](http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/) with different syntaxes, which makes your code a little bloated. If you use Sass (which you should be), this [set of mixns](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon/blob/new-flex-box/app/assets/stylesheets/css3/_flex-box.scss) makes life easier, which uses the 2009 and 2012 specs.\n\nLet's say we want to vertically align some text in a header. Here's a solution in the form of a CodePen.\n\n<p data-height=\"268\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"FgzxK\" data-default-tab=\"result\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis/pen/FgzxK/'>FgzxK</a> by Paul Adam Davis (<a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis'>@PaulAdamDavis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n## CSS tables\n\nI used to use CSS tables _a lot_, but the extra markup got a little annoying, and the flexibility of flexbox was all too alluring. That said, CSS tables work just about everywhere. The only gotcha is Firefox doesn't let you apply `position` so any table element, which can be a pain.\n\nHere's the same example as above, but using CSS tables instead.\n\n<p data-height=\"268\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"Bibvs\" data-default-tab=\"result\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis/pen/Bibvs/'>Bibvs</a> by Paul Adam Davis (<a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis'>@PaulAdamDavis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n## Padding\n\nUsing padding to vertically centre is best kept to form elements, and anywhere else where you can't add child element, including `content`. I'm sure we've all seen issues where using `line-height: 30px;` on an `<input>` leads to the blinking cursor filling the height of the input, which looks awful. The cursor also tends to only show the top half when you actually type too. It's also inconstant across browsers, so padding is your friend here.\n\nIn this code pen, I have an inout next to a button. The top set is using `line-height` for anything height related and the bottom uses padding.\n\n<p data-height=\"210\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"uvjdC\" data-default-tab=\"result\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis/pen/uvjdC/'>uvjdC</a> by Paul Adam Davis (<a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis'>@PaulAdamDavis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n## In closing...\n\nOpen each pen in a new tab and play around resizing the browser.

So let's go back a few years.\nThis is a long one, grab a drink.\n\n---\n\nAfter a year of doing really cheap sites for artists on [deviantART](http://www.deviantart.com/), I got my first agency job in September 2009. I spent just under three months there, as a junior developer. The team I worked with were awesome, but almost everyone on the team had an escape plan.\n\nIn my hunt for an agency job in the year prior to getting my first, I came across an agency in London that gave me some freelance work. That agency later asked if I'd like to work for them on a full-time basis, in house. I accepted the job on the spot and handed in my notice at that first job.\n\nOn the last day of that first job, when it was time to leave, I said my goodbyes to my team and walked out, past the management, saying nothing to them.\n\nA year into the London job, I realised I was spending 1/3 of my wages getting to work, as they were two hours away. I looked for a local job, which I interviewed for twice, and got an offer which I accepted. I left that job in under 3 months again. The entire team were great, especially my fellow developers who I still look up to today. I just wasn't feeling it.\n\nI asked the London agency if they'd have me back. Luckily they said yes. I wanted to go back because I was familiar with the team. It was small and everyone was nice. I was treated as an equal.\n\nIn my time there, I got to work on some awesome stuff. I was basically the lead WP developer, which was amazing. Life was interesting and mostly fun. That was until my car died and I needed some extra cash to help pay for a new car. This is when I started doing some freelance work in the evenings.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot. Being in control of what I do, how and when was very empowering. After receiving a .net award in November 2011, I decided I wanted to try freelancing full time. Many of the people I admired in our industry were freelancers, so I kinda thought that it would help boost my profile and give me some great opportunities like speaking and traveling to work.

So let's go back a few years. <br />\nThis is a long one, grab a drink.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>After a year of doing really cheap sites for artists on <a href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/\">deviantART</a>, I got my first agency job in September 2009. I spent just under three months there, as a junior developer. The team I worked with were awesome, but almost everyone on the team had an escape plan.</p>\n\n<p>In my hunt for an agency job in the year prior to getting my first, I came across an agency in London that gave me some freelance work. That agency later asked if I'd like to work for them on a full-time basis, in house. I accepted the job on the spot and handed in my notice at that first job.</p>\n\n<p>On the last day of that first job, when it was time to leave, I said my goodbyes to my team and walked out, past the management, saying nothing to them.</p>\n\n<p>A year into the London job, I realised I was spending 1/3 of my wages getting to work, as they were two hours away. I looked for a local job, which I interviewed for twice, and got an offer which I accepted. I left that job in under 3 months again. The entire team were great, especially my fellow developers who I still look up to today. I just wasn't feeling it.</p>\n\n<p>I asked the London agency if they'd have me back. Luckily they said yes. I wanted to go back because I was familiar with the team. It was small and everyone was nice. I was treated as an equal.</p>\n\n<p>In my time there, I got to work on some awesome stuff. I was basically the lead WP developer, which was amazing. Life was interesting and mostly fun. That was until my car died and I needed some extra cash to help pay for a new car. This is when I started doing some freelance work in the evenings.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed it a lot. Being in control of what I do, how and when was very empowering. After receiving a .net award in November 2011, I decided I wanted to try freelancing full time. Many of the people I admired in our industry were freelancers, so I kinda thought that it would help boost my profile and give me some great opportunities like speaking and traveling to work. I started in April 2012.</p>\n\n<p>About 3 months into freelancing, I realised it wasn't all it was cracked up to be, but at the time it was better than commuting to work.

His recent post [comparing icon fonts and SVG's](http://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/) made me think about how I approach them, which in-turn led me to think of benefits of continuing to use then in the way I already do.\n\nThis is not an attack on Chris' article, more an addition. Another side to the coin. Before you continue though, I urge you to read Chris' article, as most of what comes below won't make sense.

Can lead to icons not being as sharp as you might expect.\n\nTrue, but text is also vector ([sometimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font#Outline_fonts)). Take a look at the example below. What looks sharper to you? I have compared this on my external display as well as a Retina MacBook Pro screen. On non-Retina, the left is sharper, where as on Retina, both are as sharp as each-other. The left is text, the HTML entity for the Apple logo, to be specific – `&#63743;`. (May not work on non-Apple devices)\n\n<p data-height=\"280\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"iJrdB\" data-default-tab=\"result\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis/pen/iJrdB/'>iJrdB</a> by Paul Adam Davis (<a href='http://codepen.io/PaulAdamDavis'>@PaulAdamDavis</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n### CSS Control\n\nCannot argue here, SVG's are easier to control specific parts.\n\n### Positioning\n\nAlso agree here, but with one exception. I usually always `position` font icons which gives you finite control, such as `top: 1px;`, so long as the `position` is `relative`, `absolute` or `fixed`, if you're mad.\n\n### Weird Failures\n\n> Inline SVG is right in the document. If the browser supports it, it displays it.\n\nWhy would anyone actually put SVG's right in the document? They're **huge**. Using SVG icons *should* be synonymous with sprites. But using sprites leaves you open to a lot of the same loading issues you get with icon fonts. Web is hard.\n\n### Semantics & Accessability\n\nAlso true, but an icon typically has no real value. It should always be accompanied by some sort of descriptive text, whether beside it or hidden inside the element containing the icon.\n\nAside: In Ghost, we add `speak: none;` to icons (see [the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html#propdef-speak)), and they're almost always coupled with text. No icon? No real problem. It's rare that an icon isnt next to some text of some sort.\n\n### Ease of Use\n\nFor the most part, Chris' points are true. Using a pre-made icon font is almost always far to heavy for anyones use.\n\nIn Ghost, we create our own icons and use [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) to create our own small font. The ttf font for ghost.org is 13kb (which has more icons than the blogging platform itself), the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) ttf is 81kb. It all makes a difference.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are 3 main ways of adding (resolution-independent) icons.\nHere's a list of the pros & cons.\n\n**Inline SVGs**\n\n* Very heavy initial HTML payload\n* Easier to style specific parts\n* Tougher to swap one icon for another\n* Only supported well in modern browsers, but fails well\n\n**SVG Sprites**\n\n* No where near as easy to use as image sprites\n* Easier to use than inline SVGs\n* Only supported well in modern browsers, but fails well\n* Tough to style (akin to styling image sprites)\n\n**Icon Fonts**\n\n* Easy to add to pretty much any element\n* Relatively small payload\n* Painless to add/remove icons\n* Best support of all the options\n\nI'll be sticking to icon fonts, rather than inline or sprited SVGs.","html":"<p>I really respect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier\">Chris Coyier</a>, he's the very reason I am in this industry.

Of course, it's open source, so please feel free to contribute in any way you can. I intend to make a load of [issues](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI/issues) on Github in the next few days so everyone is on the same page and can offer PR's where desired.\n\nTo start off, I have restructured the files and folders, with the hope that the codebase is less daunting for people to get involved in. I will blog about that at some point soon.\n\nThe next step was a `variables.scss` file, in which is a set of colour variables, used throughout the project. Before, there were no classes available to simply set the colour of an elements text or background. I know these classes are useful – especially when Ghost Apps are ready to go – so I've added some to the project.\n\nBut rather than write out two classes for each colour (for which there are 11, not the 4 shown below), I wanted to make the code as [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse) as I could, which meant some form of loop.\n\n## Prep\n\nBelow is how I've achieved this in Sass. First, we have the colour variables. \n```language-scss\n// variables.scss\n$darkgrey: #242628;\n$grey: #35393b;\n$midgrey: #7d878a;\n$lightgrey: #e2edf2;\n```\n\nSecond, we have the list of colours, which is comprised of two parts. The first attribute is the string we want to use as a selector, the second attribute is the corresponding colour variable which we previously declared.\n\n```language-scss\n// variables.scss\n$list-colours: \n    ('darkgrey' $darkgrey)\n    ('grey' $grey)\n    ('midgrey' $midgrey)\n    ('lightgrey' $lightgrey);\n```\n\n## In Use\n\nIn another file where a lot of other base styles and classes are defined, we have this. It loops over the list of colours we declared earlier and creates 2 classes for each.\n\n```language-scss\n// base.scss\n@each $colour in $list-colours {\n    .#{nth($colour, 1)}-bg {\n        background: nth($colour, 2);\n    }\n    .#{nth($colour, 1)} {\n        color: nth($colour, 2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Result\n\nThis is the compiled CSS. See why I wanted to make this DRYer when writing it?\n\n```language-css\n.darkgrey-bg {\n\tbackground: #242628;\n}\n\n.darkgrey {\n\tcolor: #242628;\n}\n\n.grey-bg {\n\tbackground: #35393b;\n}\n\n.grey {\n\tcolor: #35393b;\n}\n\n.midgrey-bg {\n\tbackground: #7d878a;\n}\n\n.midgrey {\n\tcolor: #7d878a;\n}\n\n.lightgrey-bg {\n\tbackground: #e2edf2;\n}\n\n.lightgrey {\n\tcolor: #e2edf2;\n}\n```\n\n## Conslusion\n\nThis approach means than when adding new colours to the list, they automatically get two classes generated for them. And if you don't want a class for this colour, leave it out of `$list-colours`.

I know these classes are useful – especially when Ghost Apps are ready to go – so I've added some to the project.</p>\n\n<p>But rather than write out two classes for each colour (for which there are 11, not the 4 shown below), I wanted to make the code as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse\">DRY</a> as I could, which meant some form of loop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prep\">Prep</h2>\n\n<p>Below is how I've achieved this in Sass. First, we have the colour variables.  </p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-scss\">// variables.scss\n$darkgrey: #242628;\n$grey: #35393b;\n$midgrey: #7d878a;\n$lightgrey: #e2edf2;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Second, we have the list of colours, which is comprised of two parts. The first attribute is the string we want to use as a selector, the second attribute is the corresponding colour variable which we previously declared.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-scss\">// variables.scss\n$list-colours: \n    ('darkgrey' $darkgrey)\n    ('grey' $grey)\n    ('midgrey' $midgrey)\n    ('lightgrey' $lightgrey);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"inuse\">In Use</h2>\n\n<p>In another file where a lot of other base styles and classes are defined, we have this. It loops over the list of colours we declared earlier and creates 2 classes for each.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-scss\">// base.scss\n@each $colour in $list-colours {\n    .#{nth($colour, 1)}-bg {\n        background: nth($colour, 2);\n    }\n    .#{nth($colour, 1)} {\n        color: nth($colour, 2);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"result\">Result</h2>\n\n<p>This is the compiled CSS. See why I wanted to make this DRYer when writing it?</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.darkgrey-bg {\n    background: #242628;\n}\n\n.darkgrey {\n    color: #242628;\n}\n\n.grey-bg {\n    background: #35393b;\n}\n\n.grey {\n    color: #35393b;\n}\n\n.midgrey-bg {\n    background: #7d878a;\n}\n\n.midgrey {\n    color: #7d878a;\n}\n\n.lightgrey-bg {\n    background: #e2edf2;\n}\n\n.lightgrey {\n    color: #e2edf2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"conslusion\">Conslusion</h2>\n\n<p>This approach means than when adding new colours to the list, they automatically get two classes generated for them. And if you don't want a class for this colour, leave it out of <code>$list-colours</code>. Simple.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-05-23T22:00:08.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-05-23T22:00:27.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-05-23T22:00:08.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":38,"uuid":"e4bdd3c6-e134-4078-a527-07d8d36402f0","title":"El Gouna Ghost Retreat","slug":"el-gouna-ghost-retreat","markdown":"![Ghost](/content/images/2014/May/10255983_10152191375942362_230083110035324953_o.jpg)\n\nA few months ago, [John O'Nolan](https://twitter.com/johnonolan) suggested a date for the first Ghost retreat. I penciled it into the calendar and forgot about it. A good few weeks later, on April 30th, the date was set and flights were booked. It was happening! Three of us would be flying out to Egypt to stay with John for just over a week.\n\nOn May 19th, I was on a flight with [Hannah](https://twitter.com/erisds) from Gatwick to [Hurghada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurghada). After 5 hours of looking at clouds and desert sand, we landed and were a little shell-shocked with the heat.\n\nWe had fair warning what to expect next, but it was still a shock.\n\nAs you walk into the terminal at Hurghada, everyone is shouted at by local businessman offering visa's, camels, and limousine's, which are taxis to you & I. A mass of about 20 people are shouting for attention as everyone either flocks to them or shuffles to the side of the building where you can buy a visa from an Egyptian bank, which is what we did.\n\nWe got our visas, went through passport control and baggage reclaim. We then walked outside to find our prearranged taxi driver. We found him, got in and started the drive to El Gouna, which took us through the city of Hurghada, which looked very much like a set on Call of Duty. Very dry, little greenery and some of the worst driving ever. It must be said, however, that we didn't nearly crash once. Everyone just seems to think a straight line has many curves.\n\nOur driver was great, taught us a couple Egyptian words (which I have already forgotten) and avoided deep pot holes very well. We got to El Gouna in about 30 minutes after listening to Justin Beiber and the like. Apparently that's good music to some.\n\nWe got to John's apartment, waited a little while for [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebgie) to arrive (who had just gone through the (almost exact) same journey) and had a home-made chilli. We were all sat round a table, beer in one hand, a fork in the other. 4/5 of Ghost were all in one room. It's a real shame that [Sarah](https://twitter.com/SarahLFrantz) wasn't able to make it. It felt a little empty without her there. :(\n\nEven a few days, it's hard to remember what happened each day, so I thought I'd highlight a few things we did that stick in my mind.\n\n## Breakfasts on the beach\n\n![Breakfasts on the beach](/content/images/2014/May/10333319_10152191382397362_70801864466763947_o.jpg)\n\n(I wasn't kidding!)\n\nAlmost every day, we walked down to the beach and pretty much had the same thing every single day. Eggs on toast, but with this cheese stuff that was like [Philadelphia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_cheese). It sounds simple but tasted pretty damn fantastic!\n\n## Speed Boat Lagoon Tour\n\nWe were lucky enough to be given a lagoon tour on a boat, and it was a lot of fun. And an eye opener - seeing how much of El Gouna there is on the water front. Pretty much everything of note is less than 20 meters from water.\n\n![Speedboat](/content/images/2014/May/10387168_10152191382637362_8288887288177283101_o.jpg)\n\n## Raft Building\n\nWe accepted the challenge to compete in the second annual raft building competition, held at [The Club House](https://www.facebook.com/Clubhouse.elgouna). \n\n![Raft building](/content/images/2014/May/1556470_10152191383347362_3577953486318421243_o.jpg)\n\nWe built what we thought was a solid craft. It felt solid, nothing moved a millimetre, knots were tight, beers were had. We were filled with confidence!\n\n![Other rafts](/content/images/2014/May/10285798_10152191383487362_3780582506705418060_o.jpg)\n\nWe listed diligently to the rules, heckled a little, then stood waiting for the starting signal. I pushed us off the beach into the water and we were under way! We paddled, fell behind so paddled some more. We reached the other bank well behind of the others, then our raft started to fall apart.\n\n![Swimming...](/content/images/2014/May/1276964_10152191381862362_2215690522244754020_o.jpg)\n\nUltimately, we came last and we swim back, but we did have victory flaming Sambuca, which I screwed up. Breathing out after you light the drink in your mouth is a bad idea. Fire + alcohol + extra air == OUCH!\n\n## Work\n\nY'know, sometimes we did work. Most of the week was spent planning & discussing things. I now play a big role in the re-working of [Ghost-UI](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost-ui), which is going to be a lot of fun and a steep learning curve.\n\nAside from that, we still held an IRC meeting the day after we all arrived. It was very odd. We were all sat in the [same room, with a beer](https://twitter.com/TryGhost/status/468796939157667841), in silence. We eventually migrated outside to the balcony, with another beer, mostly in silence too.\n\nThere are some parts of being distributed that are hard to let go.\n\n![Working](/content/images/2014/May/10257452_10152191382267362_4024668796589467194_o.jpg)\n\n## Motorbikes\n\nEl Gouna is technically private land. It has its own security, not a police force. Healthcare is private, infrastructure is private. It is for all intent & purposes, totally private land. As such, there's no need for license plates or even licenses to drive anything. This is why John could borrow a car to help someone out and why I could borrow a mini motorbike from a friend to simply ride around for a bit.\n\nI picked up riding a bike very quickly indeed and had doubled the previously set top speed for this particular bike. Proud.\n\n![Mini motorbike](/content/images/2014/May/10428371_10152191385087362_6658062064891751588_o.jpg)\n\n\n## Numbers\n\nI know how awesome numbers are, so throughout the week, I kept a list of what I'd personally done.\n\n**Drinks**\n\n* 16 beers\n* 10 shots\n* 6 wine\n* 2 baileys\n* 2 Caipirinha\n* 2 rum & coke\n* 2 vodka and sprites\n* 1 mojito\n\n**Things**\n\n* 7 taxis\n* 6 tuctucs\n* 4x mini motorbike rides (thrice across El Gouna, only fell off once!)\n* 3 night clubs\n* 2 free lifts\n* 1 borrowed car\n* 1 favor\n* 1 power boat\n* 1 lift on a real motorbike\n* 1 fucking amazing burger\n* 1 witnessed a supreme cock block\n* 1 beach party\n\n## Credit\n\nThank you Ghost for the amazing job, the amazing oportuntues and the amazing <s>holiday</s> meetup.\n\n![4/5 of the Ghost Foundation](/content/images/2014/May/1559331_10152191384087362_2774360693197109150_o.jpg)\n\nCredit goes to [John](https://twitter.com/johnonolan), [James](https://twitter.com/jamesslock) & [Mia](https://www.facebook.com/mia.ayoub.1) for the photos.","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/May/10255983_10152191375942362_230083110035324953_o.jpg\" alt=\"Ghost\" /></p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnonolan\">John O'Nolan</a> suggested a date for the first Ghost retreat.

It got a few retweets and favourites quite quickly, so I thought I'd share a few other tricks, as well as the one I tweeted.\n\nSome are basic tips, but ones that I spent a while finding and learning, and some are tips I have learnt from the awesome team I work with . If your Git-fu is amazing, you can probably skip them.\n\n## Set Upstream\n\n'Upstream' is the term we use for the original repo. 'Origin' is the version of the repo that you have after forking. 'Upstream' is the repo that you forked in the first place.\n\nOnce set, you can use 'upstream' instead of a URL. You'll need this set for each repo for a lot of the below tips to work.\n\n```language-bash\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/origin-owner/original-repo.git\n```\n\n## Preview a Pull Request\n\nLet's say you want to locally run a pull request to see how it works, before you merge it. How do you do that without forking their repo and running that? This, is how you do it.\n\n```language-bash\n# Step 1\ngit fetch git@github.com:acount/the-repo.git refs/pull/123/head\n# Or\ngit fetch upstream refs/pull/4/head\n\n# Step 2. Yes, 'FETCH_HEAD', verbatim\ngit checkout FETCH_HEAD\n```\n\n## Create & Delete a Tag\n\nTagging code is a good way to say _\"Okay, that's feature X done, let's tag it so people can download or run it from this point back\"._ It's exactly what we do with Ghost and Ghost-UI, though releases of Ghost-UI happen much more often to give contributors styles to work with.\n\n**Create**\n\n```language-bash\ngit tag -a 1.2.3\ngit push --tags\n```\n\t\n**Delete Tag**\n\n**Locally**\n\n```language-bash\ngit tag -d 1.2.3\n```\n\n**Remotely**\n\n```language-bash\ngit tag -d 1.2.3\ngit push origin :refs/tags/1.2.3\n```\n\n## Rename Branch\n\nThere's many reasons why you'll want to rename a branch. You can rename another branch or the currently checked out branch.\n\n\\#protip: Think of `-m` as `move`.\n\n**From any branch**\n\n```language-bash\ngit branch -m <oldname> <newname>\n```\n\n**From current branch**\n\n```language-bash\ngit branch -m <newname>\n```\n\n## Interactive Rebase\n\nThis is how you merge commits together. If you ever contribute to Ghost, you'll need this one.\nEveryone likes a clean commit history.\n\n```language-bash\n# 8 is the number of commits to merge, so the 8 newest commits, from any author\ngit rebase -i HEAD~8\n```\n\n## Cherry-Pick\n\nLets say you want to pick a few select commits from one branch to the other, cherry-pick is your friend.\n\nFor this to work, you need to be on a different branch to the one your picking commits from. You can either use the first 10 characters from a commit hash, or the full 40 characters.\n\n```language-bash\ngit cherry-pick a1b2c3d4e5\n```\n\n## Reset to upstream\n\nLet's say you're totally fucked. Like, no one has any clue. You haven't done much work that would be disastrous to loose. Reset to upstream!\n\n**Use this with caution**. You _could_ loose days of work.\n\n```language-bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\n```\n\n---\n\nWell, there's enough tips for today.

In [March](http://dev.ghost.org/no-more-ruby-dependency/) of this year, the Sass was moved to its own repository, which meant Ghost no longer had a Ruby dependency, but had 2 repositories instead. A couple weeks ago, we decided to take the plunge and adjust our Sass so Libsass could compile it. This is why. \n\n---\n\nThere were plenty of other reasons to switch to a new repo, besides the lower dependencies:\n\n1. It was intended to make Ghost-UI a library available for general conception, like Bootstrap and Foundation.\n2. As such, separate issues between Ghost and Ghost-UI\n3. We wanted to share styles between Ghost and Ghost.org\n\nThis worked well for a while. Many people who contributed regularly knew what goes where and how we had split the two, but there were still a few who (rightly so) didn't quite get it or missed the memo.\n\nAdditionally, it made it much tougher to implement a feature that needed both HTML, JS and CSS. You'd need to make 2 pull requests - one for each repo - and discussion would happen in different places. Or, someone will do the Ember.js part and I'd do the CSS part, which is typically what happened. Pull requests needing minor changes were roadblocked on me.\n\nNow there are plenty of reasons to move it back into Ghost:\n\n1. [Libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) exists, which can be run in Node.js via [Node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) (which is a wrapper) and [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass), which is also much faster\n2. We didn't do a great job at making Ghost-UI a reusable library - I personally think it doesn't lend itself well to other projects anyway\n3. We had duplicated issues in both repos or single issues in the wrong repo\n4. We realised sharing styles between Ghost and Ghost.org its a great idea - both achieve different goals.\n5. People can work on CSS at the same time as their Ember.js stuff. Sounds primitive now I say it like that, doesn't it.\n\n## How We Did It\n\nThe way we did this might not be conventional, but it works.\n\n1. Remove any Ruby dependencies and Gems\n2. Add [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) (which bundles its own dependencies, including libsass) and adjust Grunt build tasks\n3. With `grunt watch` running, save it, see where it fails and replace that Bourbon mixin with un-prefixed code or add the mixing to our own file\n4. Do that for a couple hours and finally have a compiling code-base, via Node-sass!\n5. Add [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) via [grunt-autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer) and configure\n\nHere's what you need for the Grunt tasks. It's simplified from what we use. I'm not going to explain how wire it up, I trust you'll know where to put these.\n\n```language-javascript\n// package.json\n\"grunt-autoprefixer\": \"1.0.1\",\n\"grunt-sass\": \"~0.14.0\"\n```\n\n```language-javascript\n// Gruntfile.js\nsass: {\n    compress: {\n        options: {\n            style: 'compressed',\n            sourceMap: true\n        },\n        files: {\n            'ghost.min.css': 'screen.scss'\n        }\n    }\n},\nautoprefixer: {\n    options: {\n        map: true, // Use and update the sourcemap\n        browsers: [\"last 2 versions\", \"> 1%\", \"Explorer 10\"]\n    },\n    single_file: {\n        src: 'ghost.min.css',\n        dest: 'ghost.min.css'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWoop woop! We now have the same code-base (maybe even slightly smaller) with cleaner, prettier code.\n\n## \"replace\"? \"Bourbon\"?\n\nYes. Bourbon had been been in Ghost from very early on. I guess it was added in hope we'd use it lots. But the truth is, we only used it for prefixing things, and for the occasional helper like `clearfix` and `triangle`.\n\nWhat's the point of keeping it and having `@include`'s all over the place, for such a small benefit? We can bet better results with nicer code by using Autoprefixer.\n\n## Benefits\n\n[Hannah Wolfe](https://github.com/ErisDS) (Ghost's CTO) wrote a [good issue](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3886) detailing some of the other issues we've had, so that's definitely worth a read if you're interested.\n\nAside form the other benefits I've mentioned above, the move back into Ghost means we do longer have to deal with Bower and release tags.\n\nThe compile time is reduced from about 10 seconds to an average of 3 seconds (at least on my machine - your machine may be faster). With a ~5-6 second saving, hundreds of times a day, it really adds up.\n\nAll the issues and commit history in Ghost-UI were also moved back into Ghost, which is some kind of magic that Hannah did. Mind: blown.\n\n**\"Was It Hard?\"**<br>\nNot really. A bit time consuming, but so worth it.\n\n**\"Would I Do It Again?\"**<br>\nSure. Not that I need to, but it only took a couple hours.\n\n**\"Do you want cake?\"**<br>\nAll of it. Can I eat it?","html":"<p>In the early days of Ghost, any CSS was written in Sass, which meant Ghost had a Ruby dependency.

This is why. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>There were plenty of other reasons to switch to a new repo, besides the lower dependencies:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It was intended to make Ghost-UI a library available for general conception, like Bootstrap and Foundation.  </li>\n<li>As such, separate issues between Ghost and Ghost-UI  </li>\n<li>We wanted to share styles between Ghost and Ghost.org</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This worked well for a while. Many people who contributed regularly knew what goes where and how we had split the two, but there were still a few who (rightly so) didn't quite get it or missed the memo.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it made it much tougher to implement a feature that needed both HTML, JS and CSS. You'd need to make 2 pull requests - one for each repo - and discussion would happen in different places. Or, someone will do the Ember.js part and I'd do the CSS part, which is typically what happened. Pull requests needing minor changes were roadblocked on me.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are plenty of reasons to move it back into Ghost:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/libsass\">Libsass</a> exists, which can be run in Node.js via <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">Node-sass</a> (which is a wrapper) and <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass\">grunt-sass</a>, which is also much faster  </li>\n<li>We didn't do a great job at making Ghost-UI a reusable library - I personally think it doesn't lend itself well to other projects anyway  </li>\n<li>We had duplicated issues in both repos or single issues in the wrong repo  </li>\n<li>We realised sharing styles between Ghost and Ghost.org its a great idea - both achieve different goals.  </li>\n<li>People can work on CSS at the same time as their Ember.js stuff. Sounds primitive now I say it like that, doesn't it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"howwedidit\">How We Did It</h2>\n\n<p>The way we did this might not be conventional, but it works.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remove any Ruby dependencies and Gems  </li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass\">grunt-sass</a> (which bundles its own dependencies, including libsass) and adjust Grunt build tasks  </li>\n<li>With <code>grunt watch</code> running, save it, see where it fails and replace that Bourbon mixin with un-prefixed code or add the mixing to our own file  </li>\n<li>Do that for a couple hours and finally have a compiling code-base, via Node-sass!  </li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\">Autoprefixer</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer\">grunt-autoprefixer</a> and configure</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's what you need for the Grunt tasks. It's simplified from what we use. I'm not going to explain how wire it up, I trust you'll know where to put these.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// package.json\n\"grunt-autoprefixer\": \"1.0.1\",  \n\"grunt-sass\": \"~0.14.0\"  \n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Gruntfile.js\nsass: {  \n    compress: {\n        options: {\n            style: 'compressed',\n            sourceMap: true\n        },\n        files: {\n            'ghost.min.css': 'screen.scss'\n        }\n    }\n},\nautoprefixer: {  \n    options: {\n        map: true, // Use and update the sourcemap\n        browsers: [\"last 2 versions\", \"&gt; 1%\", \"Explorer 10\"]\n    },\n    single_file: {\n        src: 'ghost.min.css',\n        dest: 'ghost.min.css'\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Woop woop! We now have the same code-base (maybe even slightly smaller) with cleaner, prettier code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"replacebourbon\">\"replace\"? \"Bourbon\"?</h2>\n\n<p>Yes. Bourbon had been been in Ghost from very early on. I guess it was added in hope we'd use it lots. But the truth is, we only used it for prefixing things, and for the occasional helper like <code>clearfix</code> and <code>triangle</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What's the point of keeping it and having <code>@include</code>'s all over the place, for such a small benefit? We can bet better results with nicer code by using Autoprefixer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ErisDS\">Hannah Wolfe</a> (Ghost's CTO) wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3886\">good issue</a> detailing some of the other issues we've had, so that's definitely worth a read if you're interested.</p>\n\n<p>Aside form the other benefits I've mentioned above, the move back into Ghost means we do longer have to deal with Bower and release tags.</p>\n\n<p>The compile time is reduced from about 10 seconds to an average of 3 seconds (at least on my machine - your machine may be faster). With a ~5-6 second saving, hundreds of times a day, it really adds up.</p>\n\n<p>All the issues and commit history in Ghost-UI were also moved back into Ghost, which is some kind of magic that Hannah did. Mind: blown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Was It Hard?\"</strong><br>\nNot really. A bit time consuming, but so worth it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Would I Do It Again?\"</strong><br>\nSure. Not that I need to, but it only took a couple hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Do you want cake?\"</strong><br>\nAll of it.

February 2nd, 2011, I passed by test first time and fell in love with the freedom the roads offered me.\n\n---\n\nIn the months before I learnt to drive, I was stupid (or lucky) enough to buy the car my brother was looking to sell. A year 2000 black 1.8l 3 door Ford Focus with a Miltek exhaust my brother fitted.

I never had any problems with it, it was cheap to run and didn't stand out. It was comfy and quiet for the 4 hours I drove it each day going to work in West London and back.\n\nThis car only lasted until November 2011 though, when I was crashed into by a someone with an Audi A3 (remember that). They bent the chassis and the car had to be scrapped.\n\n---\n\nI went a month with no car and had to use crashes and trains to get to work. I knew I needed another car, and the search was on.\n\nThe search wasn't long though. I remember having a light-bulb moment: I wanted a car that was reliable, nippy, looked good and  was stronger that the Focus. I fell in love the 1998 3 door 1.8T Audi A3 8L with 150bhp. I found one on EBay, bought it and loved it.\n\n![Audi A3](/content/images/2014/11/388166_10151000322296513_714287015_n.jpg)\n\nThe Audi was my first turbo car - it even made that adrenaline inducing 'push' wound when the turn dumped its excess air, after I fitted an aftermarket record valve anyway. It was also my first car with leather, and a Bose stereo. I was starting to get used to the luxuries cars can offer, even if they were in a 14 year old, slightly ageing box.\n\nThe car was older and had done a fair few miles, so I was adamant I'd take good care of it. I saved and had the bushed changed, I put the best tyres I could get on it, and the best brakes. I cleaned it weekly and regularly checked the fluids. It was well loved.\n\nThe car handled better than the Ford, was faster, and stopped better. It helped me fall in love with country lanes. Sadly, on a trip back from a conference, it dies a slow death; leaking oil for 30 miles between London and my house. It finally gave up 2 miles from home - the clutch and gearbox had both died. I left it at the road side, found the place it has been lifted to, signed some papers and never saw it again.\n\n---\n\nBy this point, I was a freelancer, so had a little more money coming in. I had also been driving for a year & a half. I felt like I deserved a newer and nicer car. The next search was on.\n\nA large portion of my searching was balancing engine power, looks and insurance costs. Turns out a 2003 BMW 318i coupé was the answer. I saved £2800 and almost as much for insurance and finally bought one.\n\n![BMW 318](/content/images/2014/11/521696_10151353323836513_1556669377_n.jpg)\n\nI loved this car even more than the Ford or Audi. It was a much better looking car, and had even more toys than the Audi! Heated seats, buttons on the steering wheel and a better stereo. I was even more chuffed.\n\nThe car was filled with problems though. The cooling system leaked so much I was using more coolant than petrol until I fixed it. The timing chain snapped. The exhaust had a hole in. The wheels where badly curbed.\n\nBut, the interior was perfect, other than a small tear in the drivers seat. Everything worked and I could easily fit an aftermarket stereo which left be plug my phone in by USB so I could control it properly.\n\nIt was this car that made me - what I would call - a good driver. I learnt to handle drifts, purposefully or accidentally.  It *felt* so much more engaging to drive. I knew that the front wheels were doing and knew how far I could push it before the arse let go, and even then I could safely bring it back.\n\nI truly loved this car, but I wanted something faster. I wanted something that scared me a bit. I felt I had explored all the car had to offer me.\n\nI spent a few weeks running the numbers and looking at other cars.\n\n---\n\nThe night of the Ghost launch party in London, I was talking to someone about all this and they said \"just do it man, just do it\". The next day, I did it.\n\nI drove down a big car dealer near me, and bought a 2006 BMW 335i coupé.\n\n![BMW 335i](/content/images/2014/11/1978876_10152347761761513_6894848437560406697_n.jpg)\n\nI've been in cars with power before, but nothing like this. The 335i is a twin-turbo 3 litre straight 6 with a semi-automatic 6-speed gear box with paddles. Oh. My. God.\n\nIt doesn't have any major features over my old BMW but it's a nicer place to sit. The seats, though lacking in heating, are fully electronic, right down to the posture and side support. Its mirrors automatically dim when bring lights are behind, the side mirrors file in, has automatic wipers and lights, and stops like nothing else.\n\nI vividly remember driving home from the dealer and flooring it on the motorway. Jesus fuck is that thin fast. It's limited to 155mhp - it's not hard work to get it there.\n\nI paid £10,000 for it, spread over 5 years. I thought a newer car would be less problematic. As per, my assumptions were wrong.\n\nThe high pressure fuel pump broke, the turbos developed a rattle, and the ECU died. Luckily, half of the cost to fix was covered under warranty, but my share was still expensive.\n\nTyres are £800 to replace them all, yearly road tax is £480 and I'm lucky to get 200 miles out of a full tank in town. But would I change it? Not a chance in hell.\n\nThe intoxicating nature of a powerful car is, well, intoxicating.\n\n---\n\nI often look back at my car history and wonder if I'd still have the Focus I started with, if it wasn't crashed into. I can't answer that absolutely, but I do know my choices and situations have left me wanting ever more powerful cars.\n\nIf I had the chance to go back and remake my decisions, I wouldn't change *anything*.","html":"<p>When I was 16 and still in school, I assumed I would be one of the first few people in my year to learn to drive.

I found one on EBay, bought it and loved it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/388166_10151000322296513_714287015_n.jpg\" alt=\"Audi A3\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Audi was my first turbo car - it even made that adrenaline inducing 'push' wound when the turn dumped its excess air, after I fitted an aftermarket record valve anyway. It was also my first car with leather, and a Bose stereo. I was starting to get used to the luxuries cars can offer, even if they were in a 14 year old, slightly ageing box.</p>\n\n<p>The car was older and had done a fair few miles, so I was adamant I'd take good care of it. I saved and had the bushed changed, I put the best tyres I could get on it, and the best brakes. I cleaned it weekly and regularly checked the fluids. It was well loved.</p>\n\n<p>The car handled better than the Ford, was faster, and stopped better. It helped me fall in love with country lanes. Sadly, on a trip back from a conference, it dies a slow death; leaking oil for 30 miles between London and my house. It finally gave up 2 miles from home - the clutch and gearbox had both died. I left it at the road side, found the place it has been lifted to, signed some papers and never saw it again.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>By this point, I was a freelancer, so had a little more money coming in. I had also been driving for a year &amp; a half. I felt like I deserved a newer and nicer car. The next search was on.</p>\n\n<p>A large portion of my searching was balancing engine power, looks and insurance costs. Turns out a 2003 BMW 318i coupé was the answer. I saved £2800 and almost as much for insurance and finally bought one.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/521696_10151353323836513_1556669377_n.jpg\" alt=\"BMW 318\" /></p>\n\n<p>I loved this car even more than the Ford or Audi. It was a much better looking car, and had even more toys than the Audi! Heated seats, buttons on the steering wheel and a better stereo. I was even more chuffed.</p>\n\n<p>The car was filled with problems though. The cooling system leaked so much I was using more coolant than petrol until I fixed it. The timing chain snapped. The exhaust had a hole in. The wheels where badly curbed.</p>\n\n<p>But, the interior was perfect, other than a small tear in the drivers seat. Everything worked and I could easily fit an aftermarket stereo which left be plug my phone in by USB so I could control it properly.</p>\n\n<p>It was this car that made me - what I would call - a good driver. I learnt to handle drifts, purposefully or accidentally.  It <em>felt</em> so much more engaging to drive. I knew that the front wheels were doing and knew how far I could push it before the arse let go, and even then I could safely bring it back.</p>\n\n<p>I truly loved this car, but I wanted something faster. I wanted something that scared me a bit. I felt I had explored all the car had to offer me.</p>\n\n<p>I spent a few weeks running the numbers and looking at other cars.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The night of the Ghost launch party in London, I was talking to someone about all this and they said \"just do it man, just do it\". The next day, I did it.</p>\n\n<p>I drove down a big car dealer near me, and bought a 2006 BMW 335i coupé.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/1978876_10152347761761513_6894848437560406697_n.jpg\" alt=\"BMW 335i\" /></p>\n\n<p>I've been in cars with power before, but nothing like this. The 335i is a twin-turbo 3 litre straight 6 with a semi-automatic 6-speed gear box with paddles. Oh. My. God.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't have any major features over my old BMW but it's a nicer place to sit. The seats, though lacking in heating, are fully electronic, right down to the posture and side support. Its mirrors automatically dim when bring lights are behind, the side mirrors file in, has automatic wipers and lights, and stops like nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>I vividly remember driving home from the dealer and flooring it on the motorway. Jesus fuck is that thin fast. It's limited to 155mhp - it's not hard work to get it there.</p>\n\n<p>I paid £10,000 for it, spread over 5 years. I thought a newer car would be less problematic. As per, my assumptions were wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The high pressure fuel pump broke, the turbos developed a rattle, and the ECU died. Luckily, half of the cost to fix was covered under warranty, but my share was still expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Tyres are £800 to replace them all, yearly road tax is £480 and I'm lucky to get 200 miles out of a full tank in town. But would I change it? Not a chance in hell.</p>\n\n<p>The intoxicating nature of a powerful car is, well, intoxicating.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I often look back at my car history and wonder if I'd still have the Focus I started with, if it wasn't crashed into. I can't answer that absolutely, but I do know my choices and situations have left me wanting ever more powerful cars.</p>\n\n<p>If I had the chance to go back and remake my decisions, I wouldn't change <em>anything</em>.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Cars & Driving","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-10-18T16:18:18.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-11-20T23:46:02.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-11-20T23:46:02.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":66,"uuid":"de34cc58-8109-46b4-97dd-d4b418899716","title":"My Setup","slug":"my-setup","markdown":"In lei of of better things to blog about (they're happening elsewhere), I thought I'd spend a little time and write about my current Mac setup.

It's no Aeron, but it'll do until I win the lottery.\n\nMy Mac site on a [Twelve South HiRise](https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-for-macbook).

I won't sell it - remote work kinda dictates having a laptop - but it won't get used daily. When I get that, I'll mount my current external display on its side and have a vertical screen for apps that need to be open but aren't a focus.\n\nI would also like to build my own desk (I did wood work at school, y'know) and get a [Phillips goLITE BLU energy light](http://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/HF3330_01/golite-blu-rechargeable-international-adapters), which is meant to help me feel more energetic on dreary days, which is a lot of the time in England.\n\nLastly, I want to run a ethernet cable up to the office.

I have learnt so much that I couldn't possibly list it all, and I have had the absolute pleasure of working with the most talented and gracious people I've ever met - fellow colleagues and amazing contributors alike.\n\nBut since the end of April, I no longer work with them. Now is the time to do something I've wanted to do ever since my first day in this industry - it's time to start my own thing that has room to grow. I'm going freelance again – Hello Cross Stroke!\n\n## The Work I Want (Hire me!)\n\nHaving been full-time employed for the last year, the _market_ doesn't know I exist anymore. Let's change that! I'd like to book work in to fill the next few months with projects of all sizes. Anything from a day to a few weeks.\n\nI'm looking for projects like WordPress and Ghost theming, static sites, CSS audits, and everything in-between **for June onwards**. Send me an email at [paul@crossstroke.co](paul@crossstroke.co) or...\n\n<a class=\"text-button\" href=\"https://crossstroke.co\">See the new website</a>\n\n## The Business Stuff...\n\nTogether with a brilliant accountant, we have registered as a new UK limited company, which gives me the silly title of *director*! We have setup FreeAgent, a business bank account, and everything else a company must do. I now have a company number!\n\nThis is scary stuff, and although I have a head for numbers and finances, I don't want to get this wrong. When my fiancé & I get round to buying a house and getting a mortgage, a lot rides on having correct & stable accounts.

I have learnt so much that I couldn't possibly list it all, and I have had the absolute pleasure of working with the most talented and gracious people I've ever met - fellow colleagues and amazing contributors alike.</p>\n\n<p>But since the end of April, I no longer work with them. Now is the time to do something I've wanted to do ever since my first day in this industry - it's time to start my own thing that has room to grow. I'm going freelance again – Hello Cross Stroke!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theworkiwanthireme\">The Work I Want (Hire me!)</h2>\n\n<p>Having been full-time employed for the last year, the <em>market</em> doesn't know I exist anymore.

We have setup FreeAgent, a business bank account, and everything else a company must do. I now have a company number!</p>\n\n<p>This is scary stuff, and although I have a head for numbers and finances, I don't want to get this wrong. When my fiancé &amp; I get round to buying a house and getting a mortgage, a lot rides on having correct &amp; stable accounts. Setting up the company the way we have gives us more legitimacy than being a sole trader does.
